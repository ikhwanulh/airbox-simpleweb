PROBLEM STATEMENT
Headline
Most Dashboards Show Data. Very Few Enable Control.
Many organizations already have reports and dashboards, yet still face:
KPIs that lag behind real operational issues
Task execution that cannot be monitored end-to-end
Multiple versions of performance data
Delayed decisions due to unclear ownership and status
Visibility without context does not improve performance.

If You Cannot See It in Real Time, You Cannot Manage It in Real Time
