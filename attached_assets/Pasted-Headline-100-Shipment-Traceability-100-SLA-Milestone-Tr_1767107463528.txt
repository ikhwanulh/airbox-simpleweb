PROBLEM STATEMENT
Headline
Logistics Issues Are Rarely Invisible — They Are Usually Untraceable
Most logistics operations struggle not because deliveries fail, but because:
Shipment status cannot be fully traced end-to-end
SLA milestones are not consistently recorded
Investigating delays relies on assumptions, not evidence
Operational reports cannot withstand client scrutiny
Without complete traceability, accountability breaks down.
POSITIONING STATEMENT
Headline
If You Cannot Trace It, You Cannot Control It
Kurir Pintar is built on a simple operational principle:
Every shipment must be traceable.
Every SLA milestone must be transparent.
This is the foundation of scalable and defensible logistics operations.
